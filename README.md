# HubSpot CMS for Developers II Practicum

Creating an optimised theme and webpage using HubSpot CMS.

## Installation

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to install HubSpot CMS CLI.

```bash
npm install @hubspot/cli
```

## Methodology

Whilst the practicum requirements encourage using the original 'CMS for Developers' practicum, I felt that since the focus of the course is on 'best practices', it would be more beneficial to develop these practices from even the planning stage.

As well as this, at the time of development, my first practicum is still waiting for grading. Thus, this is a good opportunity to further practise using the HubSpot CMS.

Upon reflecting on my previous practicum, I realised that the templates and modules were building blocks of a HubSpot page. Instead of applying the styling in a theme override file, I applied the theme styles as I was creating each template.

So this time, I hope to focus on a few things:

-   Mobile-first development
-   Web accessibility
-   Website performance
-   Optimising themes, sections, and modules
